#Heuristic method

Using Pulp Library 

Heuristic methods are primarily used for their ability to search an area 
quickly, particularly in real-world problems with many variables and options 
to deal with. Despite their speed and ease of use, they find a good feasible 
solution rather than an optimal one. As a result, an easy and simple 
constructive method of acting greedy and attempting to find three cheapest 
with the lowest cost (sum of fixed and variable costs) is used. 
In this manner, it first determines the three cheapest facilities to activate 
and then selects one of those three at random.
